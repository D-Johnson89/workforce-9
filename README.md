# Workforce-9

### This website serves as both a learning experience and a more major project to add to my portfolio.

*I intend to rebuild this site in the future with react*

This site serves as the company site for Workforce 9. A virtual space renting and building company.
the site will include a slide-show in the homepage, where each image will link to the particular space for rent.
The navbar will have a button that takes you to a gallery where you will be presented with one of the pictures 
from the available spaces, and when clicked, it will take you to the particular space available, with more pictures,
and the form to rent the space. Request a buid will allow you to submit a request for a new build option for a
virtual space. Lastly, Join the team will take you to a page where you can read about the staff members and be able
to apply.
